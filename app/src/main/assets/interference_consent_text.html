<title>Interference/Censorship Measurement Informed Consent</title>

<body>
<p> You are being asked to volunteer in a research study. Your participation is
    solely voluntary and opting out of the measurement will not affect your ability
    to use other features on the app, e.g. bandwidth tests.
</p>

<p>
    This project will document and analyze network interference practices around the world,
    including Internet interference and censorship. You may view aggregated reports of
    these filtering practices from www.internetcensorshiplab.org, though there is no direct
    benefit to you other than the public good of providing transparency about network interference.
</p>

<p>
    The measurements will access a list of web pages and services and record data from these tests.
    These tests will not provide any information about you to the researchers and should not
    affect your browsing experience. However, these measurements will appear to come from you
    and you may incur the following risks if you join the study:
    Your ISP or network administrator may be able to see the list of websites being accessed by
    the measurement software.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>There is a risk that accessing such websites and running these tests violates network
        policies.
    </li>
    <li>There is a risk that accessing these sensitive websites is in violation of local laws or
        regulations.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The potential risks posed by conducting these tests are highly dependent on the domestic
    political and legal context in your country. While we know of no explicit laws that
    forbid the collection of network measurements on Internet censorship, the nature of
    this research can potentially have political impacts and could be seen unfavorably
    by certain authorities. If an authority views exposure as potentially damaging then
    nationals of that country who are found to be engaged in this study may be scrutinized
    by the authorities.</p>

    tests may be in your country, you may click the link below to see an external measure

<h3>Protecting Your Privacy in this Study</h3>

<p>We will take steps to help make sure that all the information we get about you is
    kept private. We will never learn your name, though we will use a tag (unique
    alphanumerical user identifier) instead. All the study data that we get from
    you will be on a machine in a secured computer network that is only accessible
    to members of the research team. If any papers and talks are given about this
    research, neither your name nor your IP address will be used.
</p>

<p>
    Experiment data may include issuing requests for URLs found in the URL list
    (similar to what a user does manually with a browser, such as Firefox), DNS
    queries (mapping hostnames such as Google.com to IP address such as 72.14.52.3),
    or traceroutes (measuring network paths). Experiments will only log network
    traffic associated with the experiment (e.g., network packets and timestamps).
</p>

<p>
    Once an experiment has completed the resulting data will be sent, along with
    the experiment ID and user ID, to the data management system. Once the data
    management system confirms receipt of the data it will be removed from the
    client software. Sensitive data that will be collected and transmitted is the
    IP address of the user. Experiment results will be encrypted in transit to
    ensure that no identifiable information is leaked in transit.
</p>

<h3>Your Rights as a Research Subject</h3>
<ul>
